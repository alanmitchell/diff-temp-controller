# Differential Temperature Controller

This is a simple Differential Temperature Controller that uses an Arduino Pro Micro.  The specific application it was built for was to turn on a pump to transfer heat from one hydronic storage tank to another.  It could be used for other applications, such as Solar Hot Water Heater pump control.

Here is a picture of a Differential Temperature Controller built from this project:
